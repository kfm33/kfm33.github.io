<h2 style="font-size: 28px; margin-bottom: 30px;">The Place Where Stillness Feels Safe</h2>

<p>There is a woodland clearing that does not ask you to arrive calm.</p>
<p>You can arrive restless.</p>
<p>You can arrive with your thoughts racing ahead of you.</p>
<p>You can arrive already tired from holding too much.</p>
<p>The clearing does not mind.</p>

<p>The first thing you notice is the ground.</p>
<p>It is firm. It will not give way.</p>

<p>You choose a place to sit — a smooth stone or a fallen log.</p>
<p>You do not have to close your eyes. You do not have to breathe in any special way.</p>
<p>You simply sit.</p>

<p>At first, your thoughts are louder than the birds.</p>
<p>That is alright.</p>

<p>After a little while, a robin lands nearby.</p>
<p>It hops once. Twice. Then pauses.</p>
<p>You notice the pause.</p>
<p>You do not have to copy it.</p>
<p>You only notice it.</p>

<p>Some time passes.</p>
<p>A red squirrel moves through the branches overhead.</p>
<p>It stops. It listens. It moves again.</p>
<p>You notice the pattern: movement, pause, movement.</p>
<p>Your shoulders lower a fraction without you deciding to.</p>

<p>The air feels cooler now.</p>

<p>Further away, at the edge of the trees, a roe deer steps forward.</p>
<p>It is not rushing. It is not frozen.</p>
<p>It stands in quiet balance.</p>

<p>You notice your breathing has found a steadier rhythm.</p>

<p>Nothing dramatic has happened.</p>
<p>You have not solved anything.</p>
<p>But you are still here.</p>

<p>And because you are still here, the woodland reveals a little more.</p>

<p>As the light softens, an owl takes its place above.</p>
<p>It does not call immediately.</p>
<p>It waits.</p>

<p>The longer you remain, the more the clearing feels different.</p>
<p>Not silent.</p>
<p>But settled.</p>

<p>Your anxiety has not been pushed away.</p>
<p>It has simply slowed enough to sit beside you instead of ahead of you.</p>

<p><strong>Stillness is not empty.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is full.</strong></p>
<p><strong>That is the reward.</strong></p>
